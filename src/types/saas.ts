 * SaaS (multi-tenant subscription) domain types — shared by the Owner Console (separate app: lms-owner-console — keep both copies in sync) and the
 * institution admin panel (Billing & Plan, feature gating, trial banner, Domain settings, /signup).
 *
 * - A `Plan` defines prices (monthly + yearly), hard `limits` (null = unlimited) and the `features` it unlocks.
 * - An `Institution` is one tenant (school, coaching centre, company…) reachable at `<slug>.edupro.com` or
 *   its verified `customDomain`. It always carries exactly one `Subscription`.
 * - `SaasInvoice` is a bill for one paid period; `SaasEvent` is the per-institution lifecycle timeline.
 * - `SaasStore` is the whole persisted mock state (see src/lib/saasStorage.ts, localStorage `edupro_saas_v1`).
 * All timestamps are ISO-8601 strings. Money is in USD (whole dollars, may have cents for proration).
